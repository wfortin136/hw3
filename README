Part 4: create_image; G_900000_500X500.out; Circular Image.png

Instructions
Use the Makefile to compile all the source code
   
   make

To run on midway, run the batch script from home directory
  
   batch runscript.sbatch

Output will be in a file called ""hw4_analysis.out as specificed in the batch script.

To run independently, use the following commands

   ./atomic 500000 250
   ./tpriv 500000 250

Where the first number is the number of rays and the second is the gridsize
for the viewing window.

In order to plot the data, run the following
